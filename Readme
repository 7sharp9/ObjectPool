This is a simple implementation of an object pool using an agent (MailboxProcessor).

The pool is created with an initial number of objects using the specified generator.

The ObjectPool has three functions:

Put: An item can be 'Put' into the pool.
Get: An item can be taken from the pool.
ToListAndClear: A list of all the items in the pool is returned and the pool is cleared.
